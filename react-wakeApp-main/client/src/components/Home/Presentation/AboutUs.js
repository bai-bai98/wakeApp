            We are WakeApp. Our goal is to reduce road accidents due to drowsiness on the road.
            <br />
            It was important for us to make our product available all over the world so that it could be enjoyed by people from all walks of life.
            <br />

            With a team of 6 people, we have created the application that will wake you up at the first sign of drowsiness while driving!
            <br />

            Are you with us?
            <br />
            Then Wake App!
